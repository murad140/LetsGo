                    Hey there. I am Murad and I can prepare you to pass International exams like IELTS, TOEFL and Cambridge exams (A2 - C1). I have 10 years of teaching experience and I have taught in schools and universities.

                    For the last 4 years I’ve been preparing children and adults to pass exams with 100% success rate. I also teach general English but the end goal is always the same - to pass exams. It shows tangible results of my work so you I’m not here to waste your time.

                    I have a Master’s degree in linguistics and a CELTA certification.

                    Apart from teaching I do a couple of other things like:

                    being a musician
                    being an aspiring power-lifter
                    being a health enthusiast (I have a nutritionist certification)
                    being an aspiring web-developer (this web-site is run by me)
